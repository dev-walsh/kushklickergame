# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client uses **React 18** with **TypeScript** for the user interface, styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components for a consistent design system. The application follows a single-page application (SPA) pattern with client-side routing using **Wouter**. State management is handled through **TanStack Query** for server state and React hooks for local state.

The frontend is organized into:
- **Pages**: Main game view and error pages
- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by feature (game, navigation, upgrades, achievements, etc.)
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for game state management and UI utilities
- **Lib**: Utility functions for game calculations, formatting, and API communication

## Backend Architecture
The server uses **Express.js** with **TypeScript** running in ESM mode. It provides a RESTful API for game operations including player management, upgrade purchases, and leaderboard queries. The architecture supports both development and production environments with Vite integration for hot module replacement during development.

Routes are organized around core game entities:
- Player operations (CRUD, stats updates)
- Upgrade system (purchase tracking, cost calculations)
- Achievement system (progress tracking, unlocking)
- Leaderboard functionality

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses **Drizzle ORM** with **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage. The database schema includes tables for players, upgrades, achievements, and their relationships. For development and testing, an in-memory storage implementation is provided as a fallback.

Database schema includes:
- **Players**: Core user data, game stats, Solana wallet integration with network preferences
- **Upgrades**: Purchasable improvements with scaling costs
- **Player Upgrades**: Purchase tracking and quantities
- **Achievements**: Goal-based rewards system
- **Player Achievements**: Progress tracking per user

### Solana Integration Schema
- **walletAddress**: Solana wallet public key for user accounts
- **solanaNetwork**: Network preference (mainnet/devnet) with environment-based defaults
- **walletSyncEnabled**: Toggle for automatic progress synchronization
- **lastWalletSync**: Timestamp tracking for sync operations

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently implements a basic session-based system using localStorage for player identification. Players are created with auto-generated usernames and persist across browser sessions. The architecture supports future expansion to include proper authentication, wallet connections, and social login systems.
